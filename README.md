# Unsupervised Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of unsupervised learning projects! This collection showcases various techniques and algorithms used in unsupervised learning, specifically focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means Clustering, and a Recommender System.

## Projects

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction while preserving as much variance as possible. This project demonstrates how PCA can be applied to reduce the number of features in a dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze.

**Key Highlights:**
- Implementation of PCA from scratch and using libraries.
- Visualization of reduced dimensions.
- Comparison of PCA with other dimensionality reduction techniques.

### 2. K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering is a popular clustering algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets. This project explores the K-Means algorithm and its application in various scenarios.

**Key Highlights:**
- Implementation of the K-Means algorithm.
- Determination of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- Visualization of clustered data.

### 3. Recommender System
A Recommender System is a tool used to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences and behavior. This project focuses on building a recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques.

**Key Highlights:**
- Implementation of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.
- Evaluation of recommendation quality.
- Comparison with other recommendation techniques.
